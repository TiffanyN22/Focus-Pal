This is a productivity web application which will enable students to manage what they have to do as well as take notes and budget time.

It includes a calendar page which will help with time budgeting, a main list that users can input tasks and categorize them along with time estimates.
For each task the user adds, they can also access a page that will allow them to take notes which they can access later.
This page also includes a timer to help with budgeting study time for each tasks.

We used a combination of HTML, CSS, and javascript in order to create this site
